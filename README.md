# VSD TCL Workshop
## TCL
  TCL (Tool Command Language) is a programming language that is commonly used in VLSI (Very-Large-Scale Integration) to automate and script various tasks in design flow. It can be used to create scripts that automate the execution of commands in various CAD tools, such as synthesis and place-and-route tools. It can also be used to create custom scripts for tasks such as floorplanning, power analysis, and timing closure. The use of TCL allows engineers to streamline their workflows, increase productivity, and reduce human errors.

In this workshop, Synthesis is performed using Yosys

                  STA analysis using OpenTimer 1.0.5
